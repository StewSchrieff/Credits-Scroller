# Credits

This is mostly just a project where I was practicing vim. I didn't take it too seriously, and have magic numbers everywhere.


But this is a cute little script that checks your terminal size (works in at least linux) and then spits out some credits, like the movie just ended.

And, it should be fit to your window size, which is cool. I'm sure you could check the window size multiple times in the middle of the script, but here we are just checking at the beginning.
